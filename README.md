## Comparison-Based vs Rating-Based Ranking Systems

**Rating-based evaluation**: The user is asked to rate an item by providing an explicit numerical value on a scale

*Example*:
![rating_based_evaluation_example](media/rating_based_evaluation.png)

**Comparison-based evaluation**: The user is asked to compare 2 items at a time and choose which of the two is preferable

*Example*:
![comparison_based_evaluation_example](media/comparison_based_evaluation.png)

## Comparison-Based Dataset

Asking users to compare pairs of items is a more natural and reliable alternative to numerical ratings. Because of the virtues of comparison-based evaluation as a data collection method, we created a dataset to study and quantify website aesthetics.

Data were collected via [Calista Crowdsourcing App](https://github.com/calista-ai/crowdsourcing-app) that is currently running on [https://data.calista.app](https://data.calista.app).
